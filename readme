The file edited by me is: "CalcEngine3D.cpp". This project is based on One Lone Coder's console game engine, which is openly available on Youtube through his channel "Javidx9" (Github: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder).

The project is still in progress, the "CalcEngine3D.cpp" remains unedited for now. The current file is a copy of One Lone Coder's source file.
